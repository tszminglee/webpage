### Professional

I am a forth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu). I received my MA in Linguistics from [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ja) and my BA in Japanese Studies and Linguistics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk).

My research focuses on questions concerning the structure of natural languages and its mapping onto meanings and seeks answers through the lens of East Asian languages.  I am particularly interested in movement theories, linearization and modality. (see [Projects](/projects/) for more details).

I initiated the [Forum on Cantonese Linguistics](https://wordpress.com/home/focalhongkong.wordpress.com), which hosts an annual forum in Cantonese linguistics. Submit your work on Cantonese linguistics!

I run a reading group with other grad students on Chinese syntax and semantics, discussing recent papers in the area. Let me know if you are interested!


### Personal
I am from Hong Kong, a place that means a lot to me.

My Chinese name is pronounced as [lei23] [tsi25] [mɪŋ21] in IPA (or \[lei5 zi2 ming4\] in *Jyutping*). I also go by Tommy.

I run a Cantonese podcast channel [《齋・聊》](https://anchor.fm/tszmingtszming).

I host and design games for [The Joker Game](https://www.thejokergame.com).

I occasionally do some writings [here](https://www.patreon.com/tszmingtszming).

When I am doing nothing, I enjoy staring at the sky, the sea, clouds and mountains. I think they connect every place in the world, like languages.
